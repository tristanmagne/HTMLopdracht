  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I am 23 years old, born in a small town called Sneek in Netherlands province, Frysl√¢n. Historically known as
    Frisia.</p>
  <p>After having studied Informatics for 3 years at the NHL Leeuwarden, I decided to quit and take up working in the IT
    workfield. I now find myself back in school with a simular ICT education called Communication and MultiMedia Design.
